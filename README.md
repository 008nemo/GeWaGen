Clean water and food production with an ultra-low-cost, solar-powered, geothermal condenser.
# GEOTHERMAL GRADIENT ATMOSPHERIC WATER GENERATOR (GeWaGen) - MINI PROTOTYPE V1.0

This project is an ultra low-cost, energy-independent, open-source solution designed to combat water scarcity in high-humidity regions. It generates clean water by utilizing the stable, cool temperature of the Earth's subsurface to condense atmospheric moisture.

## PROJECT SUMMARY AND PERFORMANCE (1000 m² Area)

* **Philosophy:** Open Source (MIT License)
* **Area Requirement:** 31 m x 31 m (Approx. 1 acre / 1000 m²)
* **Capacity:** ≈ **250 Liters/Day** of clean water (Based on humid Gambian or coastal Africa climate).
* **Dual Benefit:** The generated water supports a drip irrigation system for greenhouse farming built atop the buried pipes, addressing both **water and food security**.

### ⚙️ KEY TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pipes** | 4 parallel lines | Optimized for the mini-prototype footprint. |
| **Pipe Diameter** | 30 cm (12 in) | Single pipe type minimizes logistics and cost. |
| **Total Pipe Length (Per Line)** | ≈ 38 m | Maximizes the condensation surface area (7m vertical + 31m horizontal). +collection pipes to water tank (2*31m) |
| **Air Velocity (Optimum)** | 3 m/s | Maximizes water yield per Watt of consumed energy. |
| **Power Consumption (Total)** | ≈ 25 Watts (DC) | Achieved with low-power computer cooling fans; fully solar independent. |
| **Condensation Enhancer** | **Free-floating spiral mesh/screen** inside the pipe. | Increases turbulence and surface area without complex mounting. |

## IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES

1.  **Depth:** The horizontal lines must be buried at a depth of around **5 meters (16.4 ft)** to reach the stable cold zone.
2.  **Thermal Spacing:** A minimum of **10 meters (33 ft)** must be maintained between pipe lines to prevent thermal interference.
3.  **Excavation:** Digging channels (approx. 50 cm wide) using an excavator is the fastest, most efficient way to reach the required depth.
4.  **Airflow:** Fan entry points should be alternated across the field to ensure even heat dissipation into the soil (See Diagram).
